# Autograb Code Submission

Thank you for considering my code submission for the Autograb project. This README provides an overview of the submission and instructions for running the code.

## Project Overview

The code submission includes the following components:

1. **Frontend:** This folder contains the frontend code for the application. It is built using React and TypeScript and includes the necessary components and styles for the form and data display.

2. **Backend:** This folder contains the backend code for the application. It is built using Express and TypeScript and includes the necessary routes and logic for handling form submissions and serving the data.

## Instructions

To run the application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/autograb.git
```
2. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:
```
cd autograb/frontend
npm install

cd ../backend
npm install
```
3. Start the frontend and backend servers:
In the frontend folder
```
npm run dev
```
In the backend folder
```
npm run start
```


4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Additional Notes

- The application allows users to select car make, model, and badge options. The form data is submitted to the backend and can be viewed on the `/details` page.

- The backend handles the form submission and returns the submitted data as a JSON response.

- Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary adjustments or improvements.
